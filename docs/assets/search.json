  "content": "How cookies work  If you have ever done any web programming, you are familiar with cookies. However, you might not be familiar with some of the unexpected ways in which cookies can create security vulnerabilities.  A look at cookies  Let us start at the beginning: what is a cookie? The HTTP cookie allows a server to store a bit of arbitrary data on the client’s device. A cookie is just a KEY=VALUE pair, with some associated attributes the direct the browser when the cookie should be used.  Cookies are just headers set by the server in the HTTP response or by the client in the HTTP request. For example:  1. client -&gt; server request  curl --head -v https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep '^&gt;'    SIDE NOTE: the `grep '^&gt;'` command will show us just the client's request headers  &gt; HEAD /wiki/Main_Page HTTP/1.1 &gt; Host: en.wikipedia.org &gt; User-Agent: curl/7.47.0 &gt; Accept: */*   2. client &lt;- server response  curl --head -v --cookie-jar /tmp/cookie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep '^&lt;'    SIDE NOTE:     * the `--cookie-jar` argument will save the cookies to the file specified     * the `grep '^&lt;'` command will show us just the server's response headers  Server responds with two Set-Cookie headers:  &lt; Set-Cookie: WMF-Last-Access=04-Nov-2016;Path=/;HttpOnly;secure;Expires=Tue, 06 Dec 2016 12:00:00 GMT &lt; Set-Cookie: GeoIP=US:::37.75:-97.82:v4; Path=/; secure; Domain=.wikipedia.org   3. client -&gt; server request  curl --head -v --cookie /tmp/cookie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep '^&gt;'  When the client next mades a request, it will send these cookies in the request header:  &gt; HEAD /wiki/Main_Page HTTP/1.1 &gt; Host: en.wikipedia.org &gt; User-Agent: curl/7.47.0 &gt; Accept: */* &gt; Cookie: WMF-Last-Access=31-Oct-2016; GeoIP=US:::37.75:-97.82:v4   Domains and Paths          If the domain is not explicitly set by the server, the browser will assign the domain based on the origin of the cookie.           Sub-domains can set cookies for the parent domain: A page can set a cookie for its own domain or any parent domain, as long as the parent domain is not a public suffix. In other words, sub.domain.org can set a cookie for domain.org, which will also be used for sub2.domain.org. Firefox and Chrome use the Public Suffix List to determine if a domain is a public suffix.           A cookie for a parent domain is always sent to the sub-domain: a cookie with domain=domain.org or domain=.domain.org will be sent to sub.domain.org. Because of this, a compromise on domain.org can result in session fixation vulnerability for all the subdomains.           Cookie scheme for determining origin is very different than the same-origin policy. The short hand version: cookie domain is a loose match, same-origin is a very strict match, including protocol and port.      Cookie Flags  A cookie flag is a suggestion to the client regarding when a cookie should be used.  Example:  Set-Cookie: KEY=VALUE; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict   Secure  The secure flag suggests to the client that they cookie should only be used for requests over https.  Why this is highly recommended:     Suppose your browser has an active session to https://securebank.int, then you type in ‘securebank.int’ in another tab. Without the Secure flag, your browser has just leaked your session id in the clear over the network! This is true even if you don’t serve any content on plaintext http and always redirect to https.   HttpOnly  This flags prevents javascript from reading the value of the cookie.  Why this is highly recommended:     This flag makes it harder for XSS attacks to hijack your session by reading the cookie and exfiltrating the session id to the attacker’s domain.   SameSite=Strict  This flag prevents the cookie from being used by other web pages when they submit forms or get resources from the cookie’s domain.  Why this is highly recommended:     SameSite restrictions are a good way to mitigate CSRF attacks.   Cookie facts     Cookie size: Cookies can hold no more than 4096 bytes.   Duplicate Cookies: It is possible to have multiple cookies with the same name for the same domain. The server must not rely on any particular order of the cookies.   Abusing Cookies  Session fixation  By resetting the session before setting critical information in the session, you protect against session fixation attacks.  Why this is important: There are many ways that an attacker can “pre-seed” a session cookie in the target’s browser. Once this is done, browsers follow a simple rule with cookies: if they have a cookie that matches the site, they send the cookie. Because of this, the website has no way to distinguish between legitimate session cookies that are created by the target and nefarious session cookies created by the attacker (and injected into the target’s browser).  Remember:     Encrypted and signed session cookies offer no defense against session fixation.   If you are using a third party authentication framework, you most likely still need to worry about resetting the session yourself. This includes SAML authentication libraries.   Session hijacking  To be written.  There are various ways that a session ID can leak. Then an attacker can assume your session.  Cross site request forgery  When a web browser submits a HTTP request, it dutifully includes all matching cookies, regardless of what web page the request came from. Without protection from Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), a web page on a completely different site can get your browser to make requests to a protected site while authenticated as you.  Remember:     Idempotent HTTP GET: You must remember to make all GET actions idempotent (does not change the data). This is because most schemes for anti-CSRF only applies to HTTP POST.   Images are not protected: Images and other assets are not protected by most anti-CSRF or the same-origin policy. If you have images with sensitive information, then you need an additional system to prevent a third party site from stealing these images.   If the application has a XSS vulnerability, then CSRF is also defeated.   Parsing cookies  To be written.  Cookies are untrusted input. If there is a bug in the parsing code, such as a JSON or XML library, then an attacker can exploit it via cookies"

When enabling CSP, we can define a whitelist of resources that the browser will load. Any resources (even including inline scripts) that are not explicitly enabled in the whitelist will be blocked by the browser.  As an exploit mitigation, it’s important to remember that while CSP makes exploitation more difficult, it does not prevent the bugs that make an exploit possible in the first place (lack of appropriate encoding/sanitization). Therefore, its protection will never be complete, and people will continue to find bypasses for even the most rigerous policies. That said, it’s an important part of a Defense in Depth strategy for any web application.  Acceptance Criteria     A policy is created that blocks any resources not required by the application   The policy is enabled via the Content-Security-Policy header   An api or service is created to parse CSP reports   Reporting is enabled via the report-uri directive   The team understands what limitations CSP adds, and how to check for violations   The team has a process for updating the policy as requirements change   Resources     https://scotthelme.co.uk/content-security-policy-an-introduction/   https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/csp/"

Wiki links  In addition to traditional Markdown syntax for links, you can use wiki-style links, like so:  \\[[page_name]] \\[[page_name|Title]] \\[[Title =&gt; page_name]]   Using wiki-style links is highly preferred, because these links will not break when a page moves and missing links will produce an error notice.  Includes  You can mix in Liquid tags in your Markdown pages. For example, this text:     {% include blah.md %}   Will insert the contents of pages/_includes/blah.md into the current page.  To include a formatted code block:     ```bash  {% include script.sh %}  ```   Simple method: editing on Github  Learning to use git can be very difficult. As an alternative, it is possible to contribute to security.git by directly editing pages through the Github website. This method does not let you preview how the page will render, but it does allow you to contribute edits without needing to install any software.  First, you need to register a github.com account. Then visit github.com/thoughtworks/security.  To edit files:     Existing Files: You can edit an existing file by clicking on the file name and then clicking the “Edit” button in the file’s toolbar (it looks like pencil). To save, type a commit message and hit the “Propose file change” button.   New Files: You can add a new page by clicking the “+” button at the end of the path breadcrumbs (e.g. “security / pages / netsec / [+]” near the top of the page). When you are done editing the content, hit the “Propose new file” button.   Boom, you are done. Someone will review the change request and either merge it right away or add comments.  Advanced method: using git and Jekyll  Clone the repository          Fork the project repository by clicking on the ‘Fork’ button near the top right of the page. This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account. For more details on how to fork a repository see this guide.           Clone your fork of the security repo from your GitHub account to your local disk:      $ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN/security.git $ cd security                Create a feature branch to hold your development changes:      $ git checkout -b my-feature                Modify the pages in your feature branch. Add changed files using git add and then git commit files:      $ git add modified_files $ git commit           Then push the changes to your GitHub account with:      $ git push -u origin my-feature                Issue a pull request      Go to https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN/security and push the button to issue a pull request. Someone will review your changes and merge them or comment on them.  Installing Jekyll  In order to preview your edits before you commit them, you will need a program called jekyll.  Install bundler for Mac:  $ brew install ruby $ gem install bundler   Install bundler on Debian/Ubuntu:  # apt install ruby ruby-dev build-essential # gem install bundler   Install jekyll:  $ cd security $ bundle   Previewing pages  When you are making changes, you can prevew the changes by running the jekyll server:  $ cd security $ make serve   Then browse to http://localhost:4000. Any page you view this way gets re-rendered when it is loaded.  After you have made changes, run this command to completely render the static HTML for the entire site:  $ cd security $ make build   Putting it all together     Go to https://github.com/thoughtworks/security and click the fork button.   Clone your fork locally: git clone ssh://git@github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN/security   Start the amber server: cd security; make serve   Edit files in security/pages   Preview changes in your browser using http://localhost:4000   When satisfied, git commit, git push   Go to https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_LOGIN/security and push the button to issue a pull request.   Keeping up to date  After a while, your fork of the repo will become out of date. In order to refresh it with the lastest upstream content:  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/thoughtworks/security $ git checkout master $ git fetch upstream $ git rebase upstream/master"

A dependency checker is a tool that attempts to detect when updates are available for third party dependencies (libraries, frameworks, etc) used in your application due to publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities.  Why is it needed?     Up to 90% of many applications are comprised of third party components.   Applications often inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities by failing to update components in a timely manner or by pulling in outdated components with vulnerabilities.   When should I use this?  All the time.  Using components with known vulnerabilities is a widespread and serious problem in application development. It can lead to easy, scannable vulnerabilities in your app. Recommended tools for a variety of languages are provided elsewhere in this project:  Tools     [[agnostic-dependency-checker]]   [[java-dependency-checker]]   [[javascript-dependency-checker]]   [[python-dependency-checker]]   [[ruby-dependency-checker]]   Further reading     https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check   Static analysis  What is it?  A static analysis tool, referred to as a Static Application Security Tool (SAST) in the context of security, identifies potential security flaws in source code, byte code, and binaries. SAST tools provide a powerful way to identify potential defects by analyzing applications from the “inside out”. This provides much greater sight into possible flaws than a scanner that only interacts with a application as a user would.  Why is it needed?     Sometimes the easiest or most obvious way to do something is also not secure. These tools provide fast feedback if a mistake is made.   Continuous, fast feedback about potential vulnerabilities saves teams time and stress.   When should I use this?     In your CI pipeline. Automatically run the scanner periodically, possibly alongside other automated tests following a checkin if it can complete quickly enough.   During manual testing. More in-depth scans can be run and verified along with the other necessary manual tests. Testers can also start to do some exploratory security testing after familiarizing themselves with typical weaknesses.

Secrets such as passwords, credentials, access tokens, certificates, and other confidential information are something we can’t allow to fall into the wrong hands. A secret management tool makes it possible to manage these kinds of secrets safely.  Why is it needed?  We see this more than you’d think. The dangers of leaving secrets into your code are wide ranging and severe. It could lead to everything from an attacker compromising a user’s session to full owning your application, and even the application server, gaining access to your database, and impersonating you to uncover more valuable data (and this is not an exhaustive list).     Applications rely on secrets to access services such as databases, encrypted files, and to securely communicate with other applications and systems.   Team members may also need a way to manage and share similar confidential information.   Writing secrets in a place they can be easily retrieved exposes projects to unnecessary risks. This includes doing things like writing them on sticky notes or in source code or configuration files.   Tools     [[agnostic-secrets-management]]"

Here are some of the main takeaways:     Accepting unvalidated input can lead to an attacker taking control of the app itself.   Setup alerts for potential attacks.   Whitelist (positive validation) expected inputs over blacklisting a set of known unwanted inputs (negative validation). Make your whitelist strict.   “Resist the temptation to filter out invalid input” aka “sanitization”. Reject invalid input altogether.   In a similar vein (and in the same blog post), take care to encode HTML output as well."

Why this is important     Even if the web server is configured to require TLS, you probably have a redirect configured from plain HTTP to HTTPS. In these cases, there are many situations where a browser might make a plain HTTP connection attempt, potentionally leaking session information in the clear. By adding an HSTS header and setting the secure flag for cookies, you instruct the browser to always require HTTPS.   Database credentials are stored in the environment  To be written  Anti-CSRF is enabled  Make sure that the top of ApplicationController has protect_from_forgery:  class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base   protect_from_forgery with: :exception end   This is the default when you create a new rails 4 application, but if you upgraded you might not have this.  What this does     Enabling protect_from_forgery will set a value session[:_csrf_token] and include authenticity_token as a parameter to all your POST requests. If the values don’t match, the exception ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken is raised.   Why this is important     When a web browser submits a HTTP request, it dutifully includes all matching cookies, regardless of what web page the request came from. Without CSRF protection, a nefarious page can get your browser to make requests to a protected site while authenticated as you.   Important details     Don’t disable exceptions: Be very careful if changing with: :exception: there are many ways to introduce a vulnerability if you do anything other than throw an exception when the authentity_token does not validate. https://nvisium.com/blog/2014/09/10/understanding-protectfromforgery/   Idempotent HTTP GET: You must remember to make all GET actions idempotent (does not change the data). This is because the Rails anti-CSRF only applies to HTTP POST.   Images are not protected: Images and other assets are not protected by the Rails anti-CSRF or the same-origin policy. If you have images with sensitive information, then you need an additional system to prevent a third party site from stealing these images.   If the application has a XSS vulnerability, then CSRF is also defeated.   See also     http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v4.2/security.html#csrf-countermeasures   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)   Cookies and sessions  Authentication always triggers a session reset  You must always call reset_session immediately before setting the user id in the session. For example:  class SessionController &lt;&lt; ApplicationController   def create     user = User.authenticate(params[:username], params[:password])     if user       reset_session       session[:user_id] = user.id       redirect_to users_path(user)     else       ...     end   end end   What this does     By resetting the session before setting critical information in the session, you protect against session fixation attacks.   Why this is important     There are many ways that an attacker can “pre-seed” a session cookie in the target’s browser. Once this is done, browsers follow a simple rule with cookies: if they have a cookie that matches the site, they send the cookie. Because of this, the website has no way to distinguish between legitimate session cookies that are created by the target and nefarious session cookies created by the attacker (and injected into the target’s browser).   Important details     Encrypted and signed session cookies offer no defense against session fixation.   Even if you are using a third party authentication framework, you may still need to worry about calling reset_session yourself. This is true when the framework does not manage the session for you, but just handles the authentication (for example, omniauth).   See also     http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v4.2/security.html#session-fixation   If used, CookieStore is used carefully  By default, Rails applications will use ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore for sessions. CookieStore is fast, but there are several pitfalls to be aware of when using CookieStore.  Do not store anything in the session…:     That is large: Cookies have a strict limit of 4k.   That you don’t want the user to see: Cookies are not encrypted, they are merely authenticated with a SHA1 digest.   That can be replayed: The user can always restore an older version of the cookie, so you can’t trust any state information stored in the user’s session.   Don’t change the default config/secrets.yml:      production:       secret_key_base: &lt;%= ENV[\"SECRET_KEY_BASE\"] %&gt;   This requires a valid session secret be created in the environment. Don’t modify this to fall back to a default value if the environment variable is not set.  Because CookieStore is easy to mess up or mis-configure, many people prefer using a traditional database-backed session storage instead.  Assets  All stylesheets have absolute paths  All stylesheets have absolute paths (to prevent CSS-injection via “Relative Path Overwrite”)  What this does     To be written   Why this is important     To be written   HTTP Headers  The gem secureheaders is enabled  The gem secureheaders allows you to conveniently configure many of best practices for HTTP headers and cookie flags.  In the apps Gemfile:  gem 'secureheaders'   In config/initializers/secure_headers.rb:  SecureHeaders::Configuration.default   What this does     Enabling this gem will give you the following default headers:   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' https:; font-src 'self' https: data:; img-src 'self' https: data:; object-src 'none'; script-src https:; style-src 'self' https: 'unsafe-inline' Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=631138519 X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-Download-Options: noopen X-Frame-Options: sameorigin X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block      And cookies:    Set-Cookie: ....; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax      Why this is important     By default, web browsers are very lax and forgiving, which is what creates a wide variety of opportunities for attack. The default headers set by secureheaders are best practices that instruct the browser to behave more strictly, and to permit many fewer avenues of attack. These options might not work with your application out of the box, but you should modify your application, if possible, to allow your site to work with these headers enabled.   Important details     secureheaders does nothing to prevent sensitive information from being cached by the web browser. For this, you must set Cache-Control header to no-store. See below.   See also     For more configuration options, see https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders/   https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet   TODO     Decide on CSP recommendation, given the vulnerabilities in almost all CSPs that don’t use a separate domain for assets.   Explore a more strict recommendation than the secureheaders default.   Sensitive content is not cached  If your application has sensitive content, you should instruct the browser to not cache the pages at all:  class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base   before_filter :no_cache_header   protected   def no_cache_header     response.headers[\"Cache-Control\"] = \"max-age=0, private, no-store\"   end end   The important element here is no-store. The Rails default of no-cache does not prevent the browser from caching the result. It just prevents the browser from using it’s cached copy without first requesting the headers to see if the content has changed.  What is the attack here? Without no-store set, anyone who walks up to the browser and opens the cache will get the full content of all pages that a user has recently visited. Only the no-store option for Cache-Control will prevent the page contents from being saved and accessible via the browser’s cache.  To view the cache, open these in the browser’s location bar:     Chrome: chrome://cache   Firefox: about:cache   Also, you should make sure that cookies and localstorage are cleared when the user logs out.  Why this is important     Web browsers store on disk and in memory a lot of information about your site, information that is potentially very sensitive. If there is a concern that an attacker might gain physical access to a computer, then it is best to make sure your site does not have it’s pages and localstorage saved.   Databases  All queries use parameter binding  For example, this:  User.where(:name =&gt; params[:name])   But NOT this:  User.where(\"name = '#{params[:name]}'\")   Some ActiveRecord methods do not use parameter binding, even though it looks like they should. For example, these are vulnerable to SQL injection:  User.calculate(:sum, params[:column]) User.exist?(params[:id])   The exist? method in ActiveRecord only performs sanitization on string arguments. But an attacker can easy craft a request that results in params[:id] being an array. For example:  User.exist?([\"id = 1) AND 0; --\"])   Will result in the following SQL:  SELECT 1 AS one FROM \"users\" WHERE (id = 1) AND 0; --) LIMIT 1   Why it is important     Parameters queries, or stored procedures with binding, are the only way to prevent SQL injection. Please do not attempt to write your own sanitization routines: it is very difficult to account for all the weird ways in which nefarious strings can get passed your filters.   TODO     There does not appear to be a proper way to do parameter binding when making SQL calls using the database connection object directly (e.g. User.connection.select_values). Recommendation? Use sequel gem?   Views  All output is filtered  Remember, all user input should be treated as untrusted and potentially hostile. This is true even if you have attempted to filter this input and only store “safe” values in the database.  By default, Rails will filter all strings that are rendered to the page:  &lt;%= possibly_user_input %&gt;   However, Rails also lets you easily bypass the filtering. All these will create the possibility of a XSS vulnerability:  &lt;%= raw possibly_user_input %&gt; &lt;%= possibly_user_input.html_safe %&gt; &lt;%= content_tag possibly_user_input %&gt; &lt;%= link_to \"Website\", possibly_user_input %&gt;   The methods raw and html_safe should used with extreme caution, and only on strings that have no user supplied input.  Routing and URLs  There is no sensitive information in any application URLs  For example, the application should never have ?session_id=e1e6a6acadc40d2 in the URL, even for requests which redirect and do not load any page content.  Why this is important     Browsers send the HTTP referrer to whatever links a user clicks on, potentially leaking the sensitive URL. Even if that is not a possibility, the browser will still send the referrer for other requests triggered by the page, such as images an stylesheets.    There are several attacks that can take advantage of this fact to exfiltrate any sensitive information in the URL. For example, “Relative Path Overwrite”.    You can still include sensitive information in the request parameters, but these values must not appear in the URL part of the request.   Authorization  The default is to require authorization  There are two approaches to authorization:     The good way: require authorization by default, and then explicitly skip it when not needed.   The bad way: have no default authorization, and only require it when needed.   The good way:  class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base   before_action :require_authorization    protected    def require_authorization     ...   end end  class HomeController &lt; ApplicationController   skip_before_action :require_authorization, only: :index   ... end   The bad way:  class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base   protected   def require_authorization     ...   end end  class InventoryController &lt; ApplicationController   before_action :require_authorization   ... end   Why this is important     For something critical like authorization, you want to practice defensive programming. If there is an error in how authorization is defined for an action, it is much better to fall back to a safe default, or a hard fail, rather than to fall back to a state that leaves your application open to attack.

Login link  Put this in a view somewhere:  &lt;%= link_to \"Log in\", login_path, class: 'login-btn' %&gt;   Add support for groups  Lets suppose you want to give access to your application to these three groups that are defined in Okta:     app_developers, with Okta group ID 0000aaaa   app_admins with Okta group ID 1111bbbb   app_readers with Okta group ID 2222cccc   The actual group IDs in Okta look more like 00g1erqthk0Why5qd0h8, but for the purpose of this tutorial we have simplified the IDs.  Add groups attribute to Okta  The first step is to modify the application configuration in Okta to add a SAML property:     Name: groups   Value: getFilteredGroups({\"0000aaaa\",\"1111bbbb\", \"2222cccc\"}, \"{group.id,group.name}\", 10)   Configure environment  Lets suppose you want to add two simple roles to your application:     Administration role: These users can edit everything.   Read only role: These users can read but not edit.   For this, create the following environment variables:  ADMIN_GROUPS – A list of SAML group IDs for users who should have full admin access to the web application.  READONLY_GROUPS – A list of SAML group IDs for users who should have READ ONLY access to the web application.  For example, in config/development.sh:  export ADMIN_GROUPS=\"0000aaaa 1111bbbb\" export READONLY_GROUPS=\"2222cccc\"   In this examples, app_developers and app_admins both gain the admin role, and app_readers gain the readonly role.  Modify SAML controller  First, add a call to resolve_group_role. This will store the role and the group name in the session when the user authenticates.    #   # A SAML service provider controller   #    class SamlController &lt; ApplicationController      def acs       response = OneLogin::RubySaml::Response.new(params[:SAMLResponse], :settings =&gt; saml_settings)       reset_session       session[:user_id] = response.nameid +     session[:role], session[:group] = resolve_group_role(response)       redirect_to start_url     end   Now lets define resolve_group_role:    class SamlError &lt; StandardError; end   rescue_from SamlError, :with =&gt; :error    private    def error(exception)     render status: 500, text: exception.to_s   end    def resolve_group_role(response)     group_str = response.attributes[\"groups\"]     if group_str.nil?       raise SamlError, \"The SAML response must include the `groups` attribute.
