# G Suite for Organizations

Text from [Digital security checklists for US Non-profits](https://ecl.gy/sec-check) by [Information Ecology](https://iecology.org) (Creative Commons: Attribute-ShareAlike)

## Introduction

Many organizations rely on Google's free online applications (Gmail, Google Docs/Sheets, GDrive, and Google Calendar among them) to do their work. While many staff access these services through individual Gmail accounts (any username that ends with @gmail.com), or a link between their work email address and an existing individual account, Google also offers G Suite: a version of these tools suited for use in organizations. G Suite provides significant advantages over individual accounts, including organizational email addresses using your chosen domain name (the part of an email address after the @ sign), administrative controls, advanced settings, 24/7 tech support for use of the tools. These features can improve your organization's technology in many areas, including helping you better secure your information by providing tighter management, control, and monitoring of your systems and how they are used.

For those organizations that have already adopted G Suite, the checklist that follows offers direction on how to set up and use the administrative controls offered by the free G Suite Basic platform to harden your organizational G Suite account and improve your overall digital security level. (In this context, "harden" means to reduce the points of vulnerability of a system by turning off or disabling functionality that is not needed.) Note that, as indicated in the associated descriptions, many of these tasks are specific implementations of checklist items from elsewhere in this set.

## Make a plan

Make a plan, preferably before deploying G Suite, detailing how your information is used by your staff, volunteers, and others, to ensure that you understand your security needs and can configure the tools correctly.

G Suite is a powerful platform with a lot of moving parts and a lot of possible configurations. As with all tools, the more time and energy you put into understanding the different users and user types you have and what features they need to use, the more effective your implementation of security controls will be. First read through this checklist to familiarize yourself with some practices you may want to employ in your G Suite setup. Then make a list of all the different groups of people you have in your organization that will be using G Suite; a typical list might be: full-time staff, part-time staff, volunteers, and board members. Then think about and list how each of those groups will need each of the various tools that are part of G Suite: e.g., to send email, to edit documents, to access your shared contacts list, to maintain a shared calendar, and so on. Does any single group need a tool that no one else needs? Conversely, does any group have no need for a tool that everyone else uses? Also think about any shared roles where multiple people need access to the same identity, email box, or set of documents -- such as an email account used to send or receive invoices, or a set of documents used for a volunteer-run hotline. Google has produced a lot of [documentation on how to plan your G Suite deployment](https://support.google.com/a/answer/4514329) (https://support.google.com/a/answer/4514329); reading through it will help you understand the applications and settings available to you in your configuration process. At a minimum, having a well-crafted plan will guide you as you step through the administrative tools at [https://admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com) and also help you formulate specific questions for G Suite support as you go through the setup.*

## Create an admin account

Create a single, dedicated account with full administrative control of G Suite ("Super Admin" permissions) and do not associate it with with any individual's email address; provide a recovery email address or phone number that is controlled by your organization or a trusted tech support provider and not an individual employee. Assign other administrative permissions appropriately.

While convenient, giving everyday user accounts permission to administer your G Suite creates risk. Doing so can mean that the loss or theft of a person's device, or a breach of their password, could put all of your organization's information at risk. Instead, sign up with or create a unique email address (like GSuite@yourdomain.org, replacing yourdomain.org with your organization's domain name) for this purpose; do not use it for anything else. Give this account "Super Admin" permissions (which means full control over your G Suite setup, including access to all calendars and accounts), remove those permissions from any other accounts (note that the account you use to perform your G Suite setup will have Super Admin permissions assigned automatically), and store the password in a safe way such as a well-configured password manager (see the [Password and Authentication Security checklist](5_authentication_checklist.md) for more information) or safety deposit box, using it only when you need to change settings in G Suite. You will be asked to give a recovery email or phone number in case of a lost password. This email or phone should be controlled by your organization or trusted delegate such as a tech support provider or affiliate organization rather than by an individual employee. You can find instructions for giving or taking away Super Admin permissions for a user at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/172176](https://support.google.com/a/answer/172176). Directions for setting up a recovery phone number or email are at [https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/183723](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/183723).

Other levels of administrative control can be assigned according to your organizational needs. For example, you could give a tech support provider Help Desk Admin permissions, which will allow them to reset passwords for people but not create users or groups. You can give control of that account to someone who does tech support without giving them total control of your systems. You can review the built-in administrative groups and find a link on how to make custom roles of your own at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/2405986](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2405986). Creating new users is the most common administrative task in many organizations and, although it may be tempting to delegate this permission to a normal operating account, gaining the power to create a user and add it to groups effectively gives a malicious actor access to all of your files until the user they create is identified and disabled, so it is best to give this permission only to specialized administrative accounts.

## Enforce password length rules

G Suite allows you to set minimum (and maximum) password lengths. Setting a minimum length of at least 12 characters helps guard against easily guessable passwords. Instructions on getting this up are at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/139399?hl=en](https://support.google.com/a/answer/139399?hl=en).

## Grant the least acceess as required

Use the organizational units functionality in G Suite to make groupings of user accounts or devices, and give them the minimum level of access required to do their work.

Giving all users ability to use all the G Suite tools in any way they want invites security risk for your organization. Instead, you should practice the security concept of "least authority"--meaning you give users only the minimum access that is required for them to do their work. For example, you may want have volunteers enter information into Google Sheets but not send email from accounts with your domain name. To allow you to control access in this way efficiently rather than on a per-user basis, G Suite provides a structure called an organizational unit. Organizational units allow you to categorize users or devices into groups, and then assign policies to each of those groups. These policies cover things like the ability to access specific tools or to apply certain settings to their accounts. You can read an overview of applying policies at [https://support.google.com/a/topic/1227584](https://support.google.com/a/topic/1227584). An article about organizational structures is at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/4352075](https://support.google.com/a/answer/4352075) and instructions for creating units is at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/182537](https://support.google.com/a/answer/182537).

Once you have created these units, you can use them to control access to services as described at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/182442](https://support.google.com/a/answer/182442) or to apply specific settings about those services as described at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/2655363](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2655363).

## Use Team Drives

Use Google Groups and Team Drive features to provide appropriate access to files for different groups of users, and to ensure that your organization always controls its own information.

Historically, one of the challenges of managing your organization's files using Google Drive has been the risk of loss of access to key documents when employees or volunteers leave the team, as well as the lack of ability to prevent sensitive information from being shared more widely than it should be. By setting up one or more Team Drives (as described at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/7212025](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7212025)), you can ensure that the Super Admin for your G Suite domain always has access to the files that are stored there. You can also apply permissions (as described at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/7337635?hl=en](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7337635?hl=en)) to a Team Drive to allow only the minimum access needed. For example, you might have organizational policy documents that everyone needs to be able to view and only certain staff members should be able to change. You can give these permissions by individual email address if your organization is small enough, and, for larger groups and easier management, you can [create Google Groups](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33329) ((https://support.google.com/a/answer/33329)) and give appropriate permissions to the Group's email address. This way when a new person comes on board or leaves a team or the organization, you need only to take them out of the relevant Google Groups or Team Drives to also remove their account's permissions to files. Note that by locking down your files in this way, your system becomes much less widely accessible to staff, and someone will need to be in charge of and regularly available for changes to permissions and group settings as needed. The increased control of your files is well worth this overhead.

It is also useful to be aware that Team Drive permissioning carries other operational tradeoffs around folder structure: it may limit who can create folders and move files around, which can benefit the clarity with which files are organized, but may also run counter to staff expectations and be quite disruptive. More expensive versions of G Suite also include Google Vault, which gives you a more robust set of tools for logging, archiving, and review of organizational documents for compliance or other reasons as described at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/2462365](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2462365).

## Turn on two-factor authentication

Turn on two-factor authentication, and, in conjunction with appropriate planning, training, and support, enforce it for all users. Use Google Authenticator codes or universal two-factor (U2F) hardware keys as a second factor rather than text message codes, and make sure staff reports immediately if their second factor is lost or stolen.

One of the advantages of G Suite as a platform is its support for two-factor authentication, whereby users prove their identity at login with two things that they know or control: 1) a password and 2) a hardware key, code produced by a program running on their computer or phone, a text message code, a phone call to a cell or landline, or even a list or codes they have printed out. Unless your organization owns and manages the cell phones that would be receiving a text message or call, it is strongly advised that all staff use a second factor that does not rely on a text message or call to a cell phone when logging into Google services, especially for any accounts with Super Admin or other administrative rights to your G Suite domain. This is because it can be surprisingly easy for someone to take over control of a cell number via social engineering and/or fraud (see [https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/techftc/2016/06/your-mobile-phone-account-could-be-hijacked-identity-thief](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/techftc/2016/06/your-mobile-phone-account-could-be-hijacked-identity-thief), [https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/10/how-activist-deray-mckessons-twitter-account-was-hacked/](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/10/how-activist-deray-mckessons-twitter-account-was-hacked/), and [https://threatpost.com/nist-recommends-sms-two-factor-authentication-deprecation/119507/](https://threatpost.com/nist-recommends-sms-two-factor-authentication-deprecation/119507/) for more information).

There are several alternatives to text messaging for this purpose. Google Authenticator is available in the Google Play store for Android phones, in the App Store for iOS devices, and as a Chrome extension for use in the browser. The most common U2F hardware key is called a Yubikey and can be ordered at: [https://www.yubico.com/gafw/](https://www.yubico.com/gafw/). Using this link and logging into your G Suite admin account will allow you to order up to 50 keys at the half-price cost of $9 each.

Because of the choices available, the impact of this change on staff members' daily work, and the consequences of disrupted access to G Suite accounts, careful planning for the rollout of two-factor authentication is essential. Furthermore, enforcing two-factor authentication for all users requires each staff member to participate in this rollout in very specific ways. Refer to all the information and resources below to understand the scope of necessary planning.

Information about setup, as well as links to training materials for staff, is detailed in this document: [https://support.google.com/a/answer/175197](https://support.google.com/a/answer/175197). Have staff print backup codes (see directions: [https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538) so that they can still get into their account if their phone or hardware key is lost or stolen. Although those backup codes will allow them keep working, it is important to train users to report a lost second factor or set of backup codes to whoever is responsible for administration of your G Suite domain. Once reported lost or stolen, a security key **must** be revoked ([https://support.google.com/a/answer/2537800#seckey](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2537800#seckey)), backup codes **must** be regenerated by the user ([https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538)), or a Google Authenticator app **must** be removed as a second factor to preserve your security levels. Be aware that separate passwords for applications such as email or calendaring clients that do not support the two-factor process will become necessary, and you will want to be sure you help staff create those as outlined in this document: [https://support.google.com/a/answer/1032419](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1032419).

You can also use the Advanced Security Settings, which can be applied to all of your users, or any group of users in an organizational unit, to require that two-factor authentication is set up within a certain amount of time after a user's first login. Although this may put a strain on technical support resources, it is highly recommended. Directions to enforce two-factor authentication can be found at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/2548882](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2548882).


## Make email spoofing harder

Implement controls that make it difficult for anyone to spoof email from your domain.

Google has produced a strong set of tools to allow other email systems to verify that email coming from your G Suite domain is in fact yours, preventing spoofed emails. (Email spoofing is the creation of email with a forged "from" address, generally sent with the intent to deceive the recipient.) Using them will make it very hard for your email addresses to be abused for phishing or other attacks against external parties, as well as faked internally. These tools use the latest Internet standards called Domainkeys Identified Mail (DKIM), Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records, and the associated Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC) records to do this. Documentation that will guide you through setting them all up is at [https://support.google.com/a/topic/4388154](https://support.google.com/a/topic/4388154).

Setting up DKIM, SPF, and DMARC is a highly technical set of tasks that involves your Domain Name Servers (DNS) in addition to Google. Your DNS may not be hosted at Google and so may require a different login; the management tools and may not have an easy interface to work within. It may be more appropriate to assign this set of tasks to your tech support provider than to do it yourself.

SPF records identify which mail servers are permitted to send email on behalf of your domain. Be aware that setting this up requires identifying **all** the services that are currently sending email on your behalf (which could be databases, mass mailing tools, email list hosts, fundraising tools, and more); incorrect configurations can cause your email to be incorrectly marked as spam. Determining this list carefully is critical to implementing this recommendation in a way that does not interrupt ongoing operations. "Hard fail” settings (records ending in "-all") are preferred for SPF records wherever possible, but be careful, as this can cause email bounces if your records are not carefully tuned. Once set up correctly, however, you will need to maintain this list and make changes any time your organization adopts any other tools that send email from the same domain as your email addresses. Other than these maintenance steps, this should be invisible in operation.

## Disable forwards

Disable users' ability to set up automatic email forwarding on their account, so that any sensitive internal emails don't end up traveling insecurely to other email accounts or remain in less-secured email systems that are vulnerable to attack.

Although it can be handy for people to be able to forward their organizational email automatically to personal or other email accounts, your organization has no control over how that email travels and how secured it is once it gets there. By allowing automatic email forwarding to other systems, you create a point of potential disclosure for internal conversations that would be otherwise locked into Google's secured infrastructure and (assuming you follow this checklist in full) protected by strong passwords and two-factor authentication. This is a simple setting that can be applied to all users or a set of users in an Organizational Unit as detailed at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/2491924](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2491924). Note this does not prevent a user from forwarding emails manually, emailing copy and pasted emails, screenshots, or downloaded copies of an email outside of your organization, so is best coupled with clear policies and guidelines in this area.

## Change sharable links settings

Change the default behavior of the "Get sharable link" feature.

Unless you change the default behavior of your G Suite, whenever anyone clicks "Get sharable link" on a folder or file, they will create a link that is open to anyone, without needing to sign into a Google account. You can and should change this default behavior so that "Get sharable link" can be used to copy-paste a document link without changing the existing permissions on the item. Instructions for finding these settings are at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/60781?hl=en](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60781?hl=en); under Link Sharing, choose "OFF." This setting will not prevent files and folders from being shared more widely by intentionally changing the item's permissions via the "Share" button.*

## Education

Educate your staff on file sharing, including the higher security of sharing by email address and risks associated with sharing files by link.

All users should be trained on the exact options available to them for sharing files in G Suite both with coworkers and external partners. This help document provides a good overview: [https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822). Though this article is clear, helpful, and very suitable for end users, document sharing and collaboration work flows can be complex; it is recommended to document some guidelines based on your organization's specific ways of working and then offer in-person or webinar trainings, with live practice, to develop shared understanding and strong usage practices among staff.

The tightest control over sharing is exercised by clicking the "Share" button and filling out the "People" field with email addresses associated with Google-based accounts, whether inside your domain or not. When sharing in this way, you can copy the link from your address bar and share it safely, as it will remain accessible only to those with whom it has been shared. (Unless your G Suite's default behavior has been changed as detailed in the above item, clicking "Get sharable link" will change the permissions so that anyone with the link can view, without logging in.)

Situations will inevitably arise where a broadly accessible link is necessary (for example, if your external collaborator does not have a Google account or you want to cast a wide net for feedback). Be sure to consider the sensitivity of the document in these situations, and, when you choose to share this way, watch out for accidentally making a file public--be sure to choose "anyone with the link" instead. You should also train users to set an expiration date on shared links, even if it is far in the future. This will ensure that the file or folder in question eventually becomes unshared. Last but not least, it is important to choose the most limited permissions appropriate--allowing people who do not need to change its contents only to view and comment on a file.

## Responsibilities

Make sure someone is assigned to regularly monitor what is happening in G Suite, has time to do so, and knows how to identify and escalate any security incidents or other concerns about abnormal usage.

Reporting on what is happening with your organizational tools and information over time is an important security practice. This is true for all tools, and an advantage of G Suite is that it makes this kind of reporting more accessible than in other tools. You want one individual or a team tasked with this ongoing monitoring, even if it's an external tech support provider, so that problems are caught quickly. Monitoring should be done on a schedule, no less than a monthly and preferably more often. To sustain this practice, it is essential that the person, team, or external provider is assigned this task via their workplan or scope of work. The goal of monitoring is to find unusual behavior, such as sudden growth in file sets or email activity, so the responsible party should first establish a baseline of normal activity and then look for trends outside of that baseline. Any questionable activity should be investigated with the users whose accounts are involved, or escalated to a tech support professional.

Activity Reports are available inside the administrative console, including use of two-factor authentication, external apps installed, emails sent/received, and file activity in Google Drive. An article describing these basic reports is at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/4580176](https://support.google.com/a/answer/4580176). A broader explanation of all the reporting available to you in G Suite can be found at [https://support.google.com/a/answer/6000239](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6000239).

In addition to this activity monitoring, it is important to regularly review the security settings of your users, especially password strength for any users not enrolled in two-factor authentication, as described here: [https://support.google.com/a/answer/2537800#password](https://support.google.com/a/answer/2537800#password). Google is continually updating their password-strength rating system in response to leaked passwords and other emerging threats, so a password that is judged strong one week may be judged weak the next. (This is less important for users with two-factor authentication, because in those cases as their password is only half of what is needed to access their account.) When you see a weak password in your systems, it should be changed. If you have regular contact with the user in question, walking them through changing to a better password is the best option. If you don't have regular access or they don't use the systems regularly, you can reset the password (using these directions: [https://support.google.com/a/answer/33319?hl=en](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33319?hl=en)) so the account is protected, and communicate the new password to them via a secure channel; if you don't have a secure channel through which to give them their new password, you can reset the password and let them know that they should go through the "forgot password" process the next time they need to log in (be sure to follow up to make sure the new password they choose is strong enough). If appropriate to your operations and the frequency of their use of the account, you can also suspend the account and reenable it as needed ([https://support.google.com/a/answer/33312?hl=en](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33312?hl=en)).

## Avoid "don't ask again"

Train users not to check the "Don't ask again on this computer" checkbox when using public or other untrusted computers, to logout after using such computers, and to untrust computers that are lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised.

This practice will help ensure that all your other efforts to create high barriers to accessing your information are successful. When a user checks the "Don't ask again on this computer" box when logging into G Suite with two-factor authentication, they are telling Google not to ask for a password or second factor for 30 days. In the case of a poorly managed (i.e., not regularly cleaned or reset) computer in a library, Internet café, or other public place, this leaves an account wide open to abuse during that period. Though Google will prompt again for password changes and other sensitive actions, that computer retains the ability to access account information, send emails, and read and edit documents. Trusted computers can always be reviewed, and trust revoked, within a user's account settings as detailed here: [https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2544838](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2544838).
